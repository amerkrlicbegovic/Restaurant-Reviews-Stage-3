# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course
---

For the Restaurant Reviews project, I convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I am take a static design that lacks accessibility and I convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users. The webiste retrieves data about restaurants from a server. The restaurants' data contain rating information about restaurants. The data main structure and images of the website is persisted in cache using a service worker and the restaurant information/list is stored in indexedDB to achieve a good Offline first experience. Furthermore, the design is responsive, to adjust properly in most/all screen displays. And finally, optimizations have been done based on results from lighthouse to ensure high score of accessibility, Optimization and Progressive Web App.

### Prerequisites

You need to have installed node.js server to run the app.

```
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
```

### Installing and running the app

1. open project directory on terminal
2. install node modules by run this npm i
3. install sails global by run this sudo npm i sails -g
4. Node.js has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Node just run `http-server`.
5. open another terminal on the same directory of project then go to the server folder and run `npm start` in the cmd for the api server to run.
6.  With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8080`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
